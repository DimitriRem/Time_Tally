# TimeTally time logging app

Hi, this project is a simple, personal time logging app that can be used by any worker such as designers, programmers or copywriters who work at an hourly rate.

The user can create projects, clients and rates. They select a project and enter details to log the time they spent on it.

They can see a consolidated view of total time spent and amounts to be charged. Ths can also be filtered to a specified date range.

## Technologies used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, React. Data handled by JSON server.

## Background

I wanted to create a React project with CRUD functionality that I can also use for my own freelance business, instead of the Excel sheets I have been using.

## Feedback always welcome

A lot of bugs still need to be ironed out but any feedback or suggestions are welcome.
